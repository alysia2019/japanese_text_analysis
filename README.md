Japanese Text Analysis Experiments
==============================

This is a set of experiments to examine word usage trends in Japanese texts.

Environment
------------
Primarily, use a conda environment to track packages and requirements needed to reproduce experiments. 
Use jupyter lab for bulk of experiments as well as Plotly Dash for visualizations and command line scripts
for building models and pulling data.

Create the conda environment via command line:
```
make create_environment
source activate japanese_text_analysis
```

Should now be able to run Jupyer Lab:
```
jupyter lab --notebook-dir=notebooks
```

Data
----

Primary sources of Japanese textual data for experiments:

The text for the "Tale of Genji": [Japanese Text Initiative](http://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/genji/) from the University of Virgninia.
Images for scroll: [Genji](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/pmjt/book/200014735/200014735.zip).
[Blog](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/japanese-text-mining/) and data for Japanese Text Minining.
